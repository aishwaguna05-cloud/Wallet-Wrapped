# Wallet-Wrapped
A Spotify-Inspired Credit Card Analytics Project

Project Overview
Wallet Wrapped is a data analytics project inspired by Spotify Wrapped that transforms raw credit card transaction data into engaging, personalized spending insights. Using Python and data visualization, the project uncovers behavioral patterns such as where money is spent most, how spending changes over time, and what kind of spender the user is.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate real-world data cleaning, feature engineering, aggregation, and storytelling through analytics.
